	abstract = {We present a group contribution method ({SoluteGC}) and a machine learning model ({SoluteML}) to predict the Abraham solute parameters, as well as a machine learning model ({DirectML}) to predict solvation free energy and enthalpy at 298 K. The proposed group contribution method uses atom-centered functional groups with corrections for ring and polycyclic strain while the machine learning models adopt a directed message passing neural network. The solute parameters predicted from {SoluteGC} and {SoluteML} are used to calculate solvation energy and enthalpy via linear free energy relationships. Extensive data sets containing 8366 solute parameters, 20,253 solvation free energies, and 6322 solvation enthalpies are compiled in this work to train the models. The three models are each evaluated on the same test sets using both random and substructure-based solute splits for solvation energy and enthalpy predictions. The results show that the {DirectML} model is superior to the {SoluteML} and {SoluteGC} models for both predictions and can provide accuracy comparable to that of advanced quantum chemistry methods. Yet, even though the {DirectML} model performs better in general, all three models are useful for various purposes. Uncertain predicted values can be identiﬁed by comparing the three models, and when the 3 models are combined together, they can provide even more accurate predictions than any one of them individually. Finally, we present our compiled solute parameter, solvation energy, and solvation enthalpy databases ({SoluteDB}, {dGsolvDBx}, {dHsolvDB}) and provide public access to our ﬁnal prediction models through a simple web-based tool, software packages, and source code.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.4851455},
	abstract = {A generalization of the recent version of the statistical associating fluid theory for variable range Mie potentials [Lafitte et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 154504 (2013)] is formulated within the framework of a group contribution approach ({SAFT}-γ Mie). Molecules are represented as comprising distinct functional (chemical) groups based on a fused heteronuclear molecular model, where the interactions between segments are described with the Mie (generalized Lennard-Jonesium) potential of variable attractive and repulsive range. A key feature of the new theory is the accurate description of the monomeric group-group interactions by application of a high-temperature perturbation expansion up to third order. The capabilities of the {SAFT}-γ Mie approach are exemplified by studying the thermodynamic properties of two chemical families, the n-alkanes and the n-alkyl esters, by developing parameters for the methyl, methylene, and carboxylate functional groups ({CH}3, {CH} 2, and {COO}). The approach is shown to describe accurately the fluid-phase behavior of the compounds considered with absolute average deviations of 1.20\% and 0.42\% for the vapor pressure and saturated liquid density, respectively, which represents a clear improvement over other existing {SAFT}-based group contribution approaches. The use of Mie potentials to describe the group-group interaction is shown to allow accurate simultaneous descriptions of the fluid-phase behavior and second-order thermodynamic derivative properties of the pure fluids based on a single set of group parameters. Furthermore, the application of the perturbation expansion to third order for the description of the reference monomeric fluid improves the predictions of the theory for the fluid-phase behavior of pure components in the near-critical region. The predictive capabilities of the approach stem from its formulation within a group-contribution formalism: predictions of the fluid-phase behavior and thermodynamic derivative properties of compounds not included in the development of group parameters are demonstrated. The performance of the theory is also critically assessed with predictions of the fluid-phase behavior (vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria) and excess thermodynamic properties of a variety of binary mixtures, including polymer solutions, where very good agreement with the experimental data is seen, without the need for adjustable mixture parameters. © 2014 {AIP} Publishing {LLC}.},

The tests not only eliminate infeasible molecules from the search space but also infeasible combinations of solvent molecules and process conditions. The tests also provide bounds for the optimization of the process model (primal problem) for each solvent, facilitating numerical solution.

	abstract = {A statistical-thermodynamics-based group contribution ({GC}) method, commensurate with the {GC} methodology used in {SAFT}-γ Mie, is proposed to model ideal heat capacities. Special treatment of halogenated groups allows many halogenated molecules to be modeled with few parameters. Parameters for small, single-group species agree well with experimental vibrational temperatures. Parameters corresponding to groups used for larger species highlight eﬀects such as anharmonicity and torsional modes. The proposed correlation consistently demonstrates higher accuracy than that of Joback and Reid. Ideal heat capacities are seldom used in isolation, but contribute to other properties that may be used to assess the quality of an equation of state. The importance of the ideal free energy to various second-derivative properties, as calculated using the {SAFT}-γ Mie equation of state, is examined. In the majority of cases, using the proposed correlation to calculate the ideal free energy results in more-accurately estimated second-derivative propertiessometimes substantially so. Further studies of the contribution of the ideal free energy are carried out revealing interesting behavior near the critical point that may relate to the Widom-Fisher and Widom lines.},

Heterosegmented {GC} approaches, on the other hand, consider molecular chains composed of diﬀerent segment types and thus maintain a more detailed picture of real molecules. Therefore, heterosegmented {GC} approaches are arguably more physically realistic and ought to give more accurate descriptions of thermodynamic properties. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a homosegmented and a heterosegmented {GC} approach based on the perturbed-chain polar {SAFT} ({PCP}-{SAFT}) equation of state ({EoS}). To ensure a meaningful comparison between both {GC} approaches, a dipole term for the heterosegmented {GC} approach is formulated. Group parameters of 22 functional groups were adjusted to pure component property data. The comparison between both {GC} approaches shows that the heterosegmented {GC} approach leads to signiﬁcantly better agreement with experimental data for various chemical families.},

	abstract = {A novel method for the estimation of aqueous solubility was solely based on simple atom contribution. Each atom in a molecule has its own contribution to aqueous solubility and was developed. Altogether 76 atom types were used to classify atoms with different chemical environments. Moreover, two correction factors, including hydrophobic carbon and square of molecular weight, were used to account for the inter-/intramolecular hydrophobic interactions and bulkiness effect. The contribution coefficients of different atom types and correction factors were generated based on a multiple linear regression using a learning set consisting of 1290 organic compounds. The obtained linear regression model possesses good statistical significance with an overall correlation coefficient (r) of 0.96, a standard deviation (s) of 0.61, and an unsigned mean error ({UME}) of 0.48. The actual prediction potential of the model was validated through an external test set with 21 pharmaceutically and environmentally interesting compounds. For the test set, a predictive r = 0.94, s = 0.84, and {UME} = 0.52 were achieved. Comparisons among eight procedures of solubility calculation for those 21 molecules demonstrate that our model bears very good accuracy and is comparable to or even better than most reported techniques based on molecular descriptors. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model to a test set of 120 molecules with a popular group contribution method developed by Klopman et al. For this test set, our model gives a very effective prediction (r = 0.96, s = 0.79, {UME} = 0.57), which is obviously superior to the predicted results (r = 0.96, s = 0.84, {UME} = 0.70) given by the Klopman's group contribution approach. Because of the adoption of atoms as the basic units, our addition model does not contain a “missing fragment” problem and thus may be more simple and universal than the group contribution models and can give predictions for any organic molecules. A program, drug-{LOGS}, had been developed to identify the occurrence of atom types and estimate the aqueous solubility of a molecule.},
