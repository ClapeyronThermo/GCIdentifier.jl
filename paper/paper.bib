	abstract = {We present a group contribution method ({SoluteGC}) and a machine learning model ({SoluteML}) to predict the Abraham solute parameters, as well as a machine learning model ({DirectML}) to predict solvation free energy and enthalpy at 298 K. The proposed group contribution method uses atom-centered functional groups with corrections for ring and polycyclic strain while the machine learning models adopt a directed message passing neural network. The solute parameters predicted from {SoluteGC} and {SoluteML} are used to calculate solvation energy and enthalpy via linear free energy relationships. Extensive data sets containing 8366 solute parameters, 20,253 solvation free energies, and 6322 solvation enthalpies are compiled in this work to train the models. The three models are each evaluated on the same test sets using both random and substructure-based solute splits for solvation energy and enthalpy predictions. The results show that the {DirectML} model is superior to the {SoluteML} and {SoluteGC} models for both predictions and can provide accuracy comparable to that of advanced quantum chemistry methods. Yet, even though the {DirectML} model performs better in general, all three models are useful for various purposes. Uncertain predicted values can be identiﬁed by comparing the three models, and when the 3 models are combined together, they can provide even more accurate predictions than any one of them individually. Finally, we present our compiled solute parameter, solvation energy, and solvation enthalpy databases ({SoluteDB}, {dGsolvDBx}, {dHsolvDB}) and provide public access to our ﬁnal prediction models through a simple web-based tool, software packages, and source code.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the recent version of the statistical associating fluid theory for variable range Mie potentials [Lafitte et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 154504 (2013)] is formulated within the framework of a group contribution approach ({SAFT}-γ Mie). Molecules are represented as comprising distinct functional (chemical) groups based on a fused heteronuclear molecular model, where the interactions between segments are described with the Mie (generalized Lennard-Jonesium) potential of variable attractive and repulsive range. A key feature of the new theory is the accurate description of the monomeric group-group interactions by application of a high-temperature perturbation expansion up to third order. The capabilities of the {SAFT}-γ Mie approach are exemplified by studying the thermodynamic properties of two chemical families, the n-alkanes and the n-alkyl esters, by developing parameters for the methyl, methylene, and carboxylate functional groups ({CH}3, {CH} 2, and {COO}). The approach is shown to describe accurately the fluid-phase behavior of the compounds considered with absolute average deviations of 1.20\% and 0.42\% for the vapor pressure and saturated liquid density, respectively, which represents a clear improvement over other existing {SAFT}-based group contribution approaches. The use of Mie potentials to describe the group-group interaction is shown to allow accurate simultaneous descriptions of the fluid-phase behavior and second-order thermodynamic derivative properties of the pure fluids based on a single set of group parameters. Furthermore, the application of the perturbation expansion to third order for the description of the reference monomeric fluid improves the predictions of the theory for the fluid-phase behavior of pure components in the near-critical region. The predictive capabilities of the approach stem from its formulation within a group-contribution formalism: predictions of the fluid-phase behavior and thermodynamic derivative properties of compounds not included in the development of group parameters are demonstrated. The performance of the theory is also critically assessed with predictions of the fluid-phase behavior (vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria) and excess thermodynamic properties of a variety of binary mixtures, including polymer solutions, where very good agreement with the experimental data is seen, without the need for adjustable mixture parameters. © 2014 {AIP} Publishing {LLC}.},

The tests not only eliminate infeasible molecules from the search space but also infeasible combinations of solvent molecules and process conditions. The tests also provide bounds for the optimization of the process model (primal problem) for each solvent, facilitating numerical solution.

Special treatment of halogenated groups allows many halogenated molecules to be modeled with few parameters. Parameters for small, single-group species agree well with experimental vibrational temperatures. Parameters corresponding to groups used for larger species highlight eﬀects such as anharmonicity and torsional modes. The proposed correlation consistently demonstrates higher accuracy than that of Joback and Reid. Ideal heat capacities are seldom used in isolation, but contribute to other properties that may be used to assess the quality of an equation of state. The importance of the ideal free energy to various second-derivative properties, as calculated using the {SAFT}-γ Mie equation of state, is examined. In the majority of cases, using the proposed correlation to calculate the ideal free energy results in more-accurately estimated second-derivative propertiessometimes substantially so. Further studies of the contribution of the ideal free energy are carried out revealing interesting behavior near the critical point that may relate to the Widom-Fisher and Widom lines.},

Heterosegmented {GC} approaches, on the other hand, consider molecular chains composed of diﬀerent segment types and thus maintain a more detailed picture of real molecules. Therefore, heterosegmented {GC} approaches are arguably more physically realistic and ought to give more accurate descriptions of thermodynamic properties. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a homosegmented and a heterosegmented {GC} approach based on the perturbed-chain polar {SAFT} ({PCP}-{SAFT}) equation of state ({EoS}). To ensure a meaningful comparison between both {GC} approaches, a dipole term for the heterosegmented {GC} approach is formulated. Group parameters of 22 functional groups were adjusted to pure component property data. The comparison between both {GC} approaches shows that the heterosegmented {GC} approach leads to signiﬁcantly better agreement with experimental data for various chemical families.},

	abstract = {A novel method for the estimation of aqueous solubility was solely based on simple atom contribution. Each atom in a molecule has its own contribution to aqueous solubility and was developed. Altogether 76 atom types were used to classify atoms with different chemical environments. Moreover, two correction factors, including hydrophobic carbon and square of molecular weight, were used to account for the inter-/intramolecular hydrophobic interactions and bulkiness effect. The contribution coefficients of different atom types and correction factors were generated based on a multiple linear regression using a learning set consisting of 1290 organic compounds. The obtained linear regression model possesses good statistical significance with an overall correlation coefficient (r) of 0.96, a standard deviation (s) of 0.61, and an unsigned mean error ({UME}) of 0.48. The actual prediction potential of the model was validated through an external test set with 21 pharmaceutically and environmentally interesting compounds. For the test set, a predictive r = 0.94, s = 0.84, and {UME} = 0.52 were achieved. Comparisons among eight procedures of solubility calculation for those 21 molecules demonstrate that our model bears very good accuracy and is comparable to or even better than most reported techniques based on molecular descriptors. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model to a test set of 120 molecules with a popular group contribution method developed by Klopman et al. For this test set, our model gives a very effective prediction (r = 0.96, s = 0.79, {UME} = 0.57), which is obviously superior to the predicted results (r = 0.96, s = 0.84, {UME} = 0.70) given by the Klopman's group contribution approach. Because of the adoption of atoms as the basic units, our addition model does not contain a “missing fragment” problem and thus may be more simple and universal than the group contribution models and can give predictions for any organic molecules. A program, drug-{LOGS}, had been developed to identify the occurrence of atom types and estimate the aqueous solubility of a molecule.},

Group contribution methods link the target property to contributions based on chemical groups or other molecular subunits of a given molecule. However, the fragmentation of the molecule into its subunits is usually done manually impeding the fast testing and development of new group contribution methods based on large databases of molecules. The aim of this work is to develop strategies to overcome the challenges that arise when attempting to fragment molecules automatically while keeping the definition of the groups as simple as possible. Furthermore, these strategies are implemented in two fragmentation algorithms. The first algorithm finds only one solution while the second algorithm finds all possible fragmentations. Both algorithms are tested to fragment a database of 20,000+ molecules for use with the group contribution model Universal Quasichemical Functional Group Activity Coefficients ({UNIFAC}). Comparison of the results with a reference database shows that both algorithms are capable of successfully fragmenting all the molecules automatically. Furthermore, when applying them on a larger database it is shown, that the newly developed algorithms are capable of fragmenting structures previously thought not possible to fragment.},

	abstract = {Constructing high-quality libraries of molecular building blocks is essential for successful fragment-based drug discovery. In this communication, we describe {eMolFrag}, a new open-source software to decompose organic compounds into nonredundant fragments retaining molecular connectivity information. Given a collection of molecules, {eMolFrag} generates a set of unique fragments comprising larger moieties, bricks, and smaller linkers connecting bricks. These building blocks can subsequently be used to construct virtual screening libraries for targeted drug discovery. The robustness and computational performance of {eMolFrag} is assessed against the Directory of Useful Decoys, Enhanced database conducted in serial and parallel modes with up to 16 computing cores. Further, the application of {eMolFrag} in de novo drug design is illustrated using the adenosine receptor. {eMolFrag} is implemented in Python, and it is available as stand-alone software and a web server at www.brylinski.org/emolfrag and https://github.com/liutairan/{eMolFrag}.},

	abstract = {A general limiting law is proposed which can be used to systematize the various laws of additivity of molecular properties. This can be stated as follows: ``If φ is a molecular property, then for the disproportionation reaction: {RNR}+{SNS}⇄2RNS, Δφ→0 as the separation between R and S becomes large compared to their dimensions.It is shown that the zero‐order approximation is equivalent to the law of additivity of atomic properties, the first‐order approximation to the law of additivity of bond properties, the second‐order approximation to the law of additivity of group properties, and so forth. It is shown that for Cp and S° (ideal gases), the additivity of atomic properties works to about ±2 cal/mole‐°K, while the additivity of bond properties is usually good to about ±1 cal/mole‐°K. The latter also estimates ΔHf° to about ±3 kcal/mole. The group additivity relation is generally obeyed to within ±0.5 cal/mole‐°K for Cp and S° and about ±0.6 kcal/mole for ΔHf°. Tables are presented for each of the partial properties at 25°C.The agreements found for the various additivity rules is examined from a molecular point of view and certain extensions and limitations indicated. The application and utility of the rules in estimation of thermodynamic properties is discussed.The estimation of bond dissociation energies is possible with the additivity rules as are the thermodynamic properties of free radicals. An application of the rules to species {NR}2 and {NS}2 show that R and S may be ordered according to their general bond‐weakening or bond‐strengthening properties. For systems where N is C2H4 it is shown that the first and second bond dissociation energies for {RC}2H4R is very likely a constant = 59.5 kcal, the excitation energy of C2H4.},

	abstract = {Entropy scaling has proven to be a powerful method for calculating transport properties. The applicability of the entropy scaling approach to predict the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and self-diffusion coefficients of pure substances based on substance-specific parameters over the last years was convincingly demonstrated in the literature. In this work, we derive a predictive method for the thermal conductivity based on entropy scaling. The model is developed as a group-contribution approach where substances are considered to be composed of chemical (functional) groups. The excess entropy is calculated using the group-contribution {PCP}-{SAFT} equation of state. The model is applicable for gaseous phases and for liquid-phase conditions covering wide ranges of temperature and pressure. We consider pure fluids from various chemical families, namely, alkanes, branched alkanes, cyclic alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, aromatics, esters, ethers, ketones and alcohols, and some individual substances, such as water, carbon dioxide, and the like. We propose parameters of 29 chemical groups by considering 231 substances with more than 50,000 experimental data points. The group-contribution method for the thermal conductivity proposed in this work is shown to be in convincing agreement with experimental data with 6.17\% average absolute deviation for all considered data points.},

	abstract = {Models for surfactants need to incorporate the amphiphilic character of the molecules to describe key properties such as the adsorption at interfaces and the reduction of interfacial tensions. One possibility is to model the surfactant molecules as heteronuclear chains. Therefore, we revisit the heterosegmented density functional theory and present a theory consistent with the group contribution perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory equation of state. The model is used to study water/surfactant and water/surfactant/octane systems with surfactants from the group of polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers, a commonly used group of nonionic surfactants. The model parameters are obtained by fitting to pure component data of small surfactants. Binary interaction parameters are required to model the water/alkane subsystem and to account for the polarity of the head groups of the surfactant. The model is able to reproduce the significant enrichment of surfactant molecules at both vapor–liquid surfaces and liquid–liquid interfaces and the corresponding reduction of interfacial tensions. For liquid–liquid interfaces, the competing solubility of the surfactant in both phases has to be taken into account when searching for an optimal surfactant molecule.},

	abstract = {Salt formation is commonly used to increase the solubility of ionisable active pharmaceutical ingredients ({APIs}) and is monitored via a {pH}-solubility profile of the {API} and its salt. Due to the extremely low solubilities of many {APIs} in water, experiments are difficult to perform, and reliable predictive tools can be especially useful in this context. Here, we use the {SAFT}-γ Mie group-contribution equation of state to predict the phase diagrams and the {pH}-dependent solubility of two acidic {APIs}: ibuprofen and ketoprofen. We consider ibuprofen and ketoprofen in basic buffer solutions of {NaOH}, {KOH}, {LiOH}, {RbOH}, Ca({OH})2, Mg({OH})2, n-hexylamine, n-octylamine, benzylamine and tert-butylamine, and in acidic buffer solutions of {HCl} and acetate. A predictive approach is developed in which the unlike interactions involving charged groups are either taken from previous work, calculated using combining rules or, in the case of groups originating from organic groups (e.g., {COO}−), taken to be the same as the equivalent interaction involving the neutral (uncharged) group. A new group, {NH}3+, is characterised for the case of amine buffers and salts. Equilibrium constants for the dissociation of the {APIs} and the formation of salts ({pKa} and Ksp,{AνABνB} values) are also incorporated in the model using experimental values from literature. Predictions of the complete phase diagrams of the {APIs} in water are presented, including the vapour–liquid, liquid–liquid (oiling out), and solid–liquid (solubility) equilibria. The {SAFT}-γ Mie approach is shown to provide accurate predictions of the solid–liquid solubility of the compounds, as well as of the presence of liquid–liquid separation. Furthermore, the {pH}-solubility profiles of the {APIs} at T=298.15 K and 310.15 K for the range of buffers and salts considered are predicted in good agreement with the available experimental data.},
